# PhyloFun
 Unity game based on phylogenetic rearrangement problems


### Building


#### Screen size
Note that the mobile WebGL does not have well working screen sizes nor a fullscreen option in the default build. To set the screen sizes correctly, use the index.html in the root of this project instead of the default one.

#### Permissions
To make the site work, don't forget to set permissions on the webGL build files. Otherwise the online version of the app won't work.
